{"title":"My Favorite Self Coaching Exercise to Examine Hard Problems","slug":"four-self-coaching-questions","md":"<p>One book that seriously changed my perspective on helping people and changing myself is Motivational Interviewing. It came as a recommendation from one of my favorite people, John Berardi. What is the practice of motivational interviewing? According to Wikipedia:</p>\n<blockquote>It is a directive, client-centered counseling style for eliciting behavior change by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"theexercise\">The Exercise</h2>\n<p>The exercise is in the style of Motivational Interviewing. It’s great for evaluating any change you’re considering. I learned about it at the end of my year of Precision Nutrition Coaching. It is comprised of these four questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is GOOD about NOT changing?</li>\n<li>What might you give up or lose if you changed or pursued this new Goal?</li>\n<li>What is bad about NOT changing?</li>\n<li>What is GOOD about changing?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These questions aren’t necessarily intuitive, but under the right circumstances, asking them can lead to great insight. For example:</p>\n<p><em>What is GOOD about choosing NOT to lead an average life?</em></p>\n<p><em>What might I give up or lose if I choose to lead an average life?</em></p>\n<p><em>What is bad about NOT choosing to leading an average life?</em></p>\n<p><em>What is GOOD about choosing to lead an average life?</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If I’m honest with myself, I should use this exercise more often. When I do, I understand my wants and needs more clearly, and I am more likely to act.</p>"}
